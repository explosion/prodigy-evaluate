# ðŸ”Ž Prodigy-evaluate

This repository contains a Prodigy plugin for recipes to evaluate spaCy pipelines. It features two recipes:

1. `evaluate`: This recipe evaluates a spaCy pipeline on a dataset of annotated examples. 
2. `evaluate-example`:  

It computes a variety of evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and more. It also supports evaluation of named entities, part-of-speech tags, and dependency labels.

Here's a preview of the `evaluate` recipe in the terminal:
