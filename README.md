# ðŸ”Ž Prodigy-evaluate

This repository contains a Prodigy plugin for recipes to evaluate spaCy pipelines. It features two recipes:

1. `evaluate`: Evaluate a spaCy pipeline on one or more datasets for different components. Per-component evaluation sets can be provided using the `eval:` prefix for consistency. Passing flags like `--label-stats` or `--confusion-matrix` will compute a variety of evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and more. 

2. `evaluate-example`: Evaluate a spaCy pipeline on one or more datasets for different components on a **per-example basis**. This is helpful for debugging and for understanding the hardest examples for your model. 

Here's a preview of the `evaluate` recipe with some availabile parameters in the terminal:
